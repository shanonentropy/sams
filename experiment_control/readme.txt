experimental control scripts. These scripts call upon the logic built in "instrument control" folder scripts to 
enable the following experiments

* laser power temporal mapping using thorlabs power meter (needs to be tested)
* drywell temperature control (retest after refactor)
* room temperature monitoring using arroyo (retest)
* stage temp control using arroyo (to be written)
* check thermometer data logging (to be written)
* Tempearture dependent PL spectroscopy (needs to be tested)
* Temperature dependent ESR spectroscopy (needs to be tested and modified)
* Piezo control driven strain measurements (to be written)
